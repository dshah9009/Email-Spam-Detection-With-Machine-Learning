# Email Spam Detection With Machine Learning

This project is an implementation of email spam detection using machine learning. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or not spam (ham).

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Spam dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 5,574 emails, with roughly half of them being spam.

# Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the project:

pandas
scikit-learn

# Running the code
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the spam_detection.py file using python spam_detection.py.

# Results
The results of the trained model are displayed in the console, showing the accuracy of the model and the confusion matrix.

# Conclusion
In this project, we built a machine learning model that can accurately detect email spam. This model can be useful for email providers and users to filter out unwanted emails and keep their inboxes clean.
